Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The Birth of Software Engineering (1968);
The term software engineering was first coined at the 1968 NATO Software Engineering Conference.
This milestone marked the recognition of software development as an engineering discipline rather than an ad hoc process. The conference addressed the “software crisis,” where large software projects were failing due to poor planning, high costs, and unreliability. It emphasized structured programming, systematic testing, and formal methodologies to improve software quality.
2. The Rise of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) – 1980s;
Object-oriented programming (OOP) revolutionized software development by introducing concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Languages such as Smalltalk, C++, and later Java promoted reusable and modular code, making software development more efficient and scalable.
OOP led to the creation of powerful frameworks and design patterns that are still widely used today.
3. The Agile Revolution (2001);
The publication of the Agile Manifesto in 2001 transformed software development by emphasizing adaptability, collaboration, and customer-centric approaches. Agile methodologies like Scrum and Kanban replaced rigid, linear (Waterfall) development processes with iterative development cycles, improving flexibility and responsiveness to change. This milestone paved the way for modern DevOps practices, Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD), and cloud-based development. 


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process for designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software systems. It ensures software is high-quality, reliable, and cost-effective. The key phases of SDLC are:
1. Planning;
Defines project goals, scope, feasibility, and required resources. Helps in budgeting, scheduling, and risk assessment.
2. Requirement Analysis;
Involves gathering and analyzing user and business needs. Creates detailed functional and non-functional requirements.
3. Design;
Architects the system structure, database, user interfaces, and software components. Can involve high-level design (system architecture) and low-level design (detailed module design).
4. Implementation (Coding);
Developers write code based on the design specifications. Programming languages, frameworks, and tools are used to build the software.
5. Testing;
The software is tested for bugs, security issues, and functionality gaps. Types of testing include unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT).
6. Deployment;
The software is released to production or end-users.
Can involve staged rollouts or full deployment.
7. Maintenance and Support;
Fixes bugs, updates software, and improves performance based on user feedback. Ensures software continues to meet evolving business needs. 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
